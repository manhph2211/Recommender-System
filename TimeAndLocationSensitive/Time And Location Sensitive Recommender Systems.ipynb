    "### How to compute $o_i(t)$, $p_j(t)$ and $u_{is}(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The intuition for choosing the temporal form of the item bias $p_j(t)$ is that the popular- ity of an item can vary significantly with time, but it shows a high level of continuity and stability over shorter periods. Therefore, the time horizon can be split into bins of equal size, and the ratings belonging to a particular bin have the same bias. Smaller bin sizes lead to better granularity but it may also result in overfitting because enough ratings may not be present in each bin. The item bias $p_j(t)$ can now be split into a constant part and an offset parameter, which is bin-specific depending on the time $t$ at which item $j$ is rated:\n",
    "$$ p_j(t) = C_j + Offset_{j, Bin(t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both the constant part $C_j$ and offsets are parameters that need to be learned in a data-driven manner.\n",
    "2. A different approach is used to parameterize the user bias $o_i(t)$. Therefore, a functional form may be used to parameterize the user bias, which captures the concept drift of the user over time. Let the mean date of all ratings of user $i$ be denoted by $\\nu_i$. Then, the concept drift $dev_i(t)$ of user $i$ at time $t$ can be computed as a function of $t$ as follows:\n",
    "$$ dev_i(t) = sign(t â \\nu_i) . |t â \\nu_i|^\\beta $$\n",
    "The parameter $\\beta$ is selected using cross-validation. A typical value of $\\beta$ is around 0.4. In addition, the transient noise at each time t is captured with the parameters $\\epsilon_{it}$. Then, the user bias $o_i(t)$ is split into a constant part, a time-dependent part, and transient noise, as follows:\n",
    "$$ o_i(t) = K_i + \\alpha_i Â· dev_i(t) + \\epsilon_{it} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The user factors $u_{is}(t)$ correspond to the affinity of users towards various concepts. As in the case of user biases, the amount of elapsed time is a crucial factor in deciding the amount of drift. Therefore, a similar approach to user biases is used for modeling the temporal change in the user factors:\n",
    "$$ u_{is}(t) = K' + \\alpha' . dev(t) + \\epsilon'_{ist} $$\n",
    "As in the case of user biases, the constant effects, long-term effects, and transient effects are modeled by the three terms."
